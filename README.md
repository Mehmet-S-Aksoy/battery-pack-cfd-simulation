# battery-pack-cfd-simulation
CFD thermal simulation of a lithium-ion battery pack in a rectangular channel using ANSYS Fluent (based on Frontiers in CFD tutorial)
# Battery Pack CFD Simulation


##  Objective

- Prepare geometry for a rectangular channel lithium-ion battery pack
- Generate mesh and define name selections in the computational domain
- Apply boundary conditions and run thermal simulation
- Visualize results using ANSYS Fluent

##  Project Files

Since GitHub limits file upload size, the simulation archive is hosted on Google Drive:

ðŸ”— [Download the ANSYS Workbench Project (.wbpz)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V9L5PvhwIvB_rqZgaODOBK3DBZgHFPlS/view?usp=sharing)

> The file contains the complete simulation setup as demonstrated.

##  Tools Used

- ANSYS Fluent 2024 R2 (Student Version)
- Google Drive (for hosting large files)
- GitHub (project versioning)


---

##  Notes


- This project is intended for learning, sharing, and portfolio purposes.
- Mesh and setup parameters follow best practices for simple thermal analysis.
